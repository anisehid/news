what's new on AniseHID

---------------------
24 Feb 2023

It's a bit off the plan but still the `kbd-hspcb-gen` is opensourced, while the case generator is still under some modification and cleanup. Still a long way to go, hopefully we will reach a v1.0 at 24 Feb 2024

Incomming tasks:
- opensource case generator basic version
- opensource anise-ctl (community version)
- upload zmk config file

As for today marks the anniversary of the full fledged invasion of russian to ukraine, our prayers are with ukraine people as well as the putin opposition in russian. Hope a comfortable and easy to carry keyboard will enable more people in different contries to type and to express in a reasonable maner, and stop hating someone who is never met in real life.
