what's new on AniseHID

---------------------
24 Feb 2023

It's a bit off the plan but still the `kbd-hspcb-gen` is opensourced, while the case generator is still under some modification and cleanup. Still a long way to go, hopefully we will reach a v1.0 at 24 Feb 2024

Incomming tasks:
- opensource case generator basic version
- opensource anise-ctl (community version)
- upload zmk config file

As for today marks the anniversary of the full-fledged invasion of Russia to Ukraine, our prayers are with Ukraine people as well as the oppositions in Russians. Hope a comfortable and easy to carry keyboard will enable more people in different countries to type and to express in a reasonable maner, and stop hating someone who is never met in real life.
